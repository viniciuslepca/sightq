# SightQ: A better way to meet

## Our mission: 
**SightQ incorporates more data analytics for Zoom meetings to enable meeting hosts to conduct better meetings, whether that be by improving engagement, adapting presentation styles, or decreasing wasted time.**

## Built with:
- Python
- Flask
- Firebase
- Zoom API
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- React-Vis
- React-Bootstrap

## How it works
SightQ leverages a linked Zoom sign-in along with custom data analysis in creating a web portal for instructors to view analysis. This will provide insight into effectiveness of meetings, as well as giving suggestions for future improvement.
